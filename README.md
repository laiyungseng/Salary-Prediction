# Employee Salary Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

This repository contains a comprehensive notebook that demonstrates the end-to-end process of predicting employee salaries using supervised machine learning techniques. As a data scientist, I have structured the workflow to reflect both business relevance and technical rigor, suitable for real-world HR analytics applications.

## Problem Statement

Predicting employee salary is a critical component of HR analytics, workforce planning, and compensation management. The objective of this project is to build a robust machine learning model that predicts an employee's salary based on their demographic and professional attributes. Accurate salary prediction can help organizations make data-driven decisions in talent acquisition, retention, and budget allocation.

**Business Goal:**  
Use employee data to estimate salary, enabling organizations to benchmark pay, ensure internal equity, and support strategic HR initiatives.

## Data Preparation

The data is sourced from the [Kaggle Employer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gmudit/employer-data), comprising 10,000 employee records with the following fields:

- Employee_ID, Name, Age, Gender, Department, Job_Title, Experience_Years, Education_Level, Location, Salary

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   - Automated download from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
   - Extraction and loading into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Initial Exploration:**  
   - Descriptive statistics and data types inspection to identify possible data quality issues.
   - Removal of unnecessary columns (`Employee_ID`, `Name`) to prevent data leakage and maintain privacy.

3. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Checked for missing values and outliers.
   - Ensured consistency in categorical variables.

## Feature Selection & Engineering

**Feature Engineering:**
- **Label Encoding:**  
  All categorical variables (`Gender`, `Department`, `Job_Title`, `Education_Level`, `Location`) were encoded numerically using `LabelEncoder` to facilitate model compatibility.

**Feature Selection:**
- Dropped non-predictive columns.
- Prepared a final dataset with the following features:
    - **Numerical:** Age, Experience_Years
    - **Encoded Categorical:** Gender, Department, Job_Title, Education_Level, Location
- Conducted correlation analysis to understand feature relationships with the target variable (Salary).

## Model Design

The project is structured to allow for iterative model experimentation:

1. **Modeling Approach:**  
   - The problem is formulated as a regression task, predicting a continuous salary value.

2. **Model Candidates:**  
   - Multiple regression algorithms are considered (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
   - Emphasis on interpretability and predictive power.

3. **Data Splitting:**  
   - The dataset is to be split into training and test sets for robust performance evaluation.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   - Grid search or similar optimization techniques are planned for model fine-tuning.

## Model Evaluation

**Planned/Typical Metrics:**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score**

Evaluation involves comparing predictions on the test set to actual salary values to assess the model's accuracy and generalizability.

**Additional Analyses:**
- Feature importance analysis to interpret which employee attributes drive salary differences.
- Residual analysis to check for systematic errors.

## Summary & Conclusion

This notebook showcases a professional, step-by-step machine learning workflow for salary prediction:

- **Business Relevance:** Addresses a real HR need with direct business impact.
- **Technical Foundations:** Demonstrates best practices in data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling.
- **Reproducibility:** Designed for execution in Google Colab with clear instructions and code organization.
- **Extensibility:** The workflow can be easily extended for advanced modeling, fairness analysis, or deployment.

**Conclusion:**  
The project lays a strong foundation for building reliable salary prediction tools. By incorporating both domain knowledge and technical expertise, it demonstrates the value a data scientist can bring to people analytics and compensation strategy.
